# Java-OOP-Inheritance
Basic Inheritance example with method overriding

Write a Java program that will ask a user to input his account balance, account type (1 for debit, 2 for credit) and transaction amount.
Steps:
 Write a class BankAccount with constructor, getters and setters, a method to credit the account balance, a method to debit the account balance and a method to display the account balance.
 Test the program by inputting any account balance, account type and transaction amount, and check the output whether the account balance is correctly debited or credited by the transaction amount.
 Write another class that inherits from the above class. Add a new method for that sub class called “Adjust” that will add or subtract a value from the balance.
 In that subclass, override the display method of the superclass by anything different.
 Test the program by creating a new object, and calling the “Adjust” method.
